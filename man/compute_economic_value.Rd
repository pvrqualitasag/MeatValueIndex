\usage{
compute_economic_value(pn_mean, pn_sd, pvec_class_freq = NULL,
  pvec_threshold = NULL, pvec_price, pn_delta_mean, pb_verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pn_mean}{empirical population mean}

\item{pn_sd}{empirical population standard deviation}

\item{pvec_class_freq}{vector of empirical trait frequencies}

\item{pvec_threshold}{vector of thresholds given by payment system}

\item{pvec_price}{vector of prices given by payment system}

\item{pn_delta_mean}{small change of population mean}
}
\value{
ev_result result of economic value
}
\description{
In this function, the economic value is computed as the change
in revenue for a given change in the population mean. The computation
of the economic value is simplified by the assumption that the
costs can be kept constant for the different levels of the population
mean.
